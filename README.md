## How to use

You can use jitpack.io to include dav4jvm:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.bitfireAT:dav4jvm:<version or commit>'  // see tags for latest version, like 1.0, or use the latest commit ID from main branch
        //implementation 'com.github.bitfireAT:dav4jvm:main-SNAPSHOT'      // use it only for testing because it doesn't generate reproducible builds
    }

dav4jvm needs a working XmlPullParser (XPP). On Android, the system already comes with
XPP and you don't need to include one; on other systems, you may need to
import for instance `org.ogce:xpp3` to get dav4jvm to work.


## Custom properties

If you use custom WebDAV properties, register the corresponding factories with `PropertyRegistry.register()`
before calling other dav4jvm methods.
